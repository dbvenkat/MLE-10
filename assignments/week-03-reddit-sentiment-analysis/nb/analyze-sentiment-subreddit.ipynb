And there's code to go with it and results can be reproduced? And open datasets to benchmark against? Ya kidding me? 10 years ago if you took latest state of the art paper and implemented it yourself, you'd find out your performance is somehow worse. That maybe some magic values were not mentioned. Or they hand-picked test sequences. Etc.\\n\\nPeople worship Google or Stanford? Few years back, the fashion was about publishing in Nature and Science and chasing impact factors. Either way, exceptional work gets recognized, that's the best you can do anyway. Get published on merit.\\n\\nSo, worried about publishing by all means, marginally pushing the envelope on state of the art and mostly just tinkering with hyper parameters until you get the result you wanted? That's just what academia has been about the past 40 years. It's an issue worth addressing, sure, but it is  not recent and not unique to any given field.\\n\\nAs for the rest.. about sexism, biased datasets, Twitter scandals or democratizing AI.. That's just the scandal of the day. In the end, opinions are like farts.. everyone has them, but maybe it's better to keep it to yourself.\",\n",
